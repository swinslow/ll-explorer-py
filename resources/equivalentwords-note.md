# Note on equivalentwords.txt file

The file `equivalentwords.txt` in this directory is a _modified_ version of
the corresponding file in the license-list-XML repository (copied as of
release 3.26.0).

It has been modified to resolve the duplicate variations of "sublicense",
so that each line has the form `toN, fromN`, to be able to convert the latter
word(s) into the former word(s) in each case without redundancy. All of the
sublicense variants will convert to the single word "sublicense".

If a new version of `equivalentwords.txt` is pulled from the license-list-XML
repository in the future, then corresponding changes should be made here.
